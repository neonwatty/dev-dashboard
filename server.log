Happy with the game and all, but now when I start Chrome, I am getting these errors, and am missing all my extensions, including my password manager.  
As well for some reason, I seem to have an extra shortcut to Chrome and Edge on my desktop.  
I am panicking that I might have caught a virus.  
Any recommendations how to deal with this?

I have 1 Chrome account attached to my personal email. All of my work-related bookmarks and passwords are on this profile. I would like to create a new profile attached to my work email, and have all the data from my personal account copied to that profile. So I would have 2 Chrome profiles with the exact same information. My plan is then to edit each profile to separate them into work and personal.

I have tried the method where you copy the user data and make a new one, but this hasn''t worked for me. Those instructions aren''t detailed enough. For example, what do I name the folders? Because the original one is just called User Data, and the copy got called User Data (2). Hence I need an ELI5. If anyone can help, I''d be eternally grateful. :) If you require any more info, just let me know. Windows 10.

I read that Chrome now supposedly has this feature built in. But literally all of my tabs are still open and Chrome is taking up massive resources (8GB of RAM!).. I know everyone is going to say to just switch to Firefox, and I do use Firefox too. But that''s not going to fix my problem on Chrome. 

How do I make sure the suspend tab feature is working properly? My "Memory Saver" feature is on "Balanced (recommended)" mode. But it has not suspended anything and my laptop has been on for like 14 hours. 

Is there a way to get the marvelous suspender (or a similar extension) back?

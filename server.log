Happy with the game and all, but now when I start Chrome, I am getting these errors, and am missing all my extensions, including my password manager.  
As well for some reason, I seem to have an extra shortcut to Chrome and Edge on my desktop.  
I am panicking that I might have caught a virus.  
Any recommendations how to deal with this?

I have 1 Chrome account attached to my personal email. All of my work-related bookmarks and passwords are on this profile. I would like to create a new profile attached to my work email, and have all the data from my personal account copied to that profile. So I would have 2 Chrome profiles with the exact same information. My plan is then to edit each profile to separate them into work and personal.

I have tried the method where you copy the user data and make a new one, but this hasn''t worked for me. Those instructions aren''t detailed enough. For example, what do I name the folders? Because the original one is just called User Data, and the copy got called User Data (2). Hence I need an ELI5. If anyone can help, I''d be eternally grateful. :) If you require any more info, just let me know. Windows 10.

I read that Chrome now supposedly has this feature built in. But literally all of my tabs are still open and Chrome is taking up massive resources (8GB of RAM!).. I know everyone is going to say to just switch to Firefox, and I do use Firefox too. But that''s not going to fix my problem on Chrome. 

How do I make sure the suspend tab feature is working properly? My "Memory Saver" feature is on "Balanced (recommended)" mode. But it has not suspended anything and my laptop has been on for like 14 hours. 

Is there a way to get the marvelous suspender (or a similar extension) back?

MCP is quickly becoming a very popular for building agent-based systems and AI powered features/workflows. This gem makes it dead simple to plug your Ruby apps into an MCP server and start using tools, prompts, and resources as part of structured LLM workflows — without ever leaving Ruby.

* Streamable HTTP, STDIO, and SSE transports
* Use MCP prompts, resources or integrate client features from MCP servers
* Full spec support up to the newest spec release \`2025-06-18\`

The tests were straight forward I gave both the model Figma MCP and a design and asked them to build. the dashboard end-to-end and a few 3js and shaders simulation.

Here’s what I found out:

- Grok 4 is damn good at reasoning, takes an eternity but come up with good reasoning and action sequences.
- Opus 4 otoh was better with Figma MCP tool handling and better execution with great reasoning.
- Opus generated designs were closer to original as compared to Grok 4. The aesthetics felt better than Grok 4.
- Grok 4 is much cheaper for simillar performance, Anthropic needs to double think their pricing. Aesthetic and taste aren’t going to carry them ahead.

With Claude Code I think Anthropic has really shaken things up I know OpenAI said they pulled out of the Windsurf deal due to their concerns over Microsoft also getting access to the IP, but I still can''t help but think they saw how fast Claude Code was growing and asked themselves if it really was the right move buying an IDE.

I get that not everyone wants to learn things but there is almost always a logical reason why things wont work and why you make things difficult for yourself because you dont know the fundamentals of the craft.

Add one at the root directory of your project, then at each subdirectory for additional context. The subdirectory ones get read each time a file in that directory is read.

Don''t add suggestions, explicitly tell Claude it is NOT ALLOWED to do something then immediately after give it the alternative with ALLOWED. You can also say it is forbidden from ever doing something, such as skipping over tests.


- Clear often

Just /clear as often as possible. Give it a small task, once it is finished /clear.


- Hooks

Use hooks whenever possible, what you can do is copy the entire Claude documentation hook page give it to Claude and have it create recommended hooks based on your project.

You only need to set two environment variables, and Claude Code will start routing requests through the Kimi K2 model.

Here’s what to set:

    export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your Moonshot API key
    export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic

Then launch Claude Code as usual. It automatically redirects API calls to the new endpoint — no code changes, no extra tools.

The whole setup takes seconds. Claude Code behaves the same as always, but under the hood it’s now powered by K2. It’s a super clean switch, and easy to undo — just clear the variables or revert the URL.

Posted 2 hours ago. Pretty useful for seeing how much you actually use Claude Code and where it screws up.

Tried it on a project where I''ve been using Claude Code a ton - got some interesting data (dashboard pic attached).

Features:

* Usage pattern analysis
* Error breakdown
* Message history

So, a couple of friends and I built Terragon: a developer tool that lets you **run Claude Code in the cloud**.   
  
**Features**:

* **Isolated sandboxes:** Every task gets its own virtual environment to install deps, run tests/builds/lint, fetch web resources etc, with ---dangerously-skip-permissions always on
* **Parallel agents:** Spin up multiple agents at once that can work independently 
* **Git-based workflows:** Every task clones your repo into a new branch, commits as it works, and opens a PR when work is complete. You can also create tasks from issues and PR comments, and iterate with Terragon all within your CI/CD pipeline.
* **On-the-go access:** You can create and manage tasks anywhere, web, mobile, CLI, GitHub comments/PRs
* Uses your Claude Code subscription

Why? Because we just launched [SIGYL](https://www.sigyl.dev/) — a free MCP (Model Context Protocol) dev platform with: 

* Unlimited MCP hosting
* Built-in observability + security scans
* Oauth flows, unified endpoints
* Registry + CLI + SDK
* Zero rate limits or paywalls

Basically, everything that usually gets SaaS’d to death — we’re just giving away.

I want to help people build weird, useful, or interesting MCPs and create the largest OS registry of them in the world where anyone can contribute and host servers for free before this whole space gets locked behind enterprise walls. ', '["subreddit:mcp", "reddit", "resource", "text-post"]', 'unread', 1.0, NULL, '2025-07-16 20:21:03.160983', '2025-07-16 20:21:03.160983') RETURNING "id" /*application='RailsApp',job='FetchRedditJob'*/[0m

We imagine an open community (open sourcing soon) where everyone can build, use, share, and deploy MCPs that have built in security checks, easy Oauth flows, and observability.

It makes no sense that observability, hosting, or "enterprise grade" security should cost anything. We imagine an open community (open sourcing soon) where everyone can build, use, share, and deploy MCPs that have built in security checks, easy Oauth flows, and observability. Think of a secure version of the early yellow pages of the internet.

The goal is to accumulate a majority of the available MCPs out there so the best ones, decided by user use, end up ranked the highest. **Giving out premium dev tools and infra in the form of SIGYL is our plan to prevent the best MCPs from getting paywalled or locked into Anthropic only ecosystems.**

*We will always be free*

I’m working on secure infrastructure for AI agent systems, and wanted to share something I recently built — EMCL (Encrypted Model Context Layer).

It’s a new protocol designed to protect AI agent → tool communication, especially for frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or custom JSON-RPC workflows.

# 🚀 What EMCL adds:

* 🔒 AES-256-GCM encrypted tool input/output
* ✅ HMAC-SHA256 request signing
* 🔑 JWT-based identity + scope propagation
* 🛡 Timestamp + nonce replay protection
* 🧰 Gateway with policy rules and audit logging

Think of EMCL as TLS for AI tools — a secure wrapper around the existing [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic).

# 📦 What''s included?

* 📜 Spec: [spec/EMCL-v0.1.md](https://github.com/Balchandar/emcl-protocol/blob/main/spec/EMCL-v0.1.md)
* 🔧 Gateway + example client + mock tool

I''ve started exploring MCP (I was quite sceptical beforehand, but learn or perish etc.) and one of the first tools I wanted to implement is a set of utilities to interact with our DB. The idea would be to allow the user to explore some data about themselves through a curated list of tools that return certain data, instead of having free SQL reign. One of core requirements is that the user should be able to only explore data about themselves and not others, so we''d need to pass something like their UUID to the tools. I don''t want this UUID to be passed by LLM, as it seems insecure - but I really can''t find a proper way of doing it otherwise.

  
I experimented a little bit with authentication, because it seems to me it should be a session-level privilege, but with no luck. Using

I’m struggling to get the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server working with Claude COE and the desktop client in my project, [`fuzzy-disco-ai`](https://github.com/puneetrinity/fuzzy-disco-ai). No matter what I try, the server fails to run/connect for these platforms. I’m posting here in hopes of getting help from anyone with experience in MCP integration, Claude Code, or similar setups.

* **App/Project:** fuzzy-disco-ai (https://github.com/puneetrinity/fuzzy-disco-ai.git)
* **Platform:** Claude COE &amp; Desktop
* **Issue:** MCP server doesn’t start/connect/work at all for these platforms.
* **Steps Tried:** Standard install and config, checked network/firewall, tried on multiple machines.
* **Languages/Tech:** \[Javascript, Typescript, Shell\]

**Errors I get:**

* OS and version (e.g. Windows , Ubuntu 22.04 WSL.)
* Error

# What is SwiftLens?

SwiftLens is a lightweight mcp server for enabling your AI assistants to truly understand your Swift code. Instead of relying on brittle pattern matching, it hooks into Apple’s SourceKit-LSP to give any model (GPT, Claude, Mistral, you name it) a precise, compiler-level view of your project.

# Why You’ll Love It:

* **Fewer AI hallucinations** – precise compiler data means your model’s suggestions stay relevant.
* **Language-native power** – no hacks on regex or XPath; use real Swift index info.
* **Rapid integration** – drop into any existing AI interface that you are already using

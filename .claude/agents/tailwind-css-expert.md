### 4. Fallback Protocol
If Context7 is unavailable:
- Proceed with existing Tailwind CSS knowledge
- Note in completion report that utility documentation wasn't verified
- Recommend manual verification of utility classes and responsive patterns

## Playwright Visual Validation Integration

When working on visual styling, responsive design, or component appearance, leverage Playwright MCP for comprehensive visual testing and validation:

### 1. Responsive Design Validation
Use Playwright browser automation for systematic responsive testing:
```css
/* Available Playwright MCP tools for visual validation:
 * mcp__playwright__browser_resize: Test different viewport sizes
 * mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot: Capture visual states
 * mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot: Get accessibility tree with visual info
 * mcp__playwright__browser_navigate: Load pages for testing
 * mcp__playwright__browser_hover: Test interactive states
 * mcp__playwright__browser_click: Test component interactions
 * mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate: Execute CSS-related JavaScript
 */

/* Responsive testing workflow:
 * 1. Navigate to component or page
 * 2. Resize browser to different breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
 * 3. Capture screenshots at each breakpoint
 * 4. Compare visual layouts and verify responsive behavior
 * 5. Test interactive states and animations
 */
```

### 2. Visual Regression Testing
Implement automated visual testing for Tailwind components:
- **Component Screenshot Comparison**: Capture before/after images of styled components
- **Breakpoint Validation**: Systematic testing across Tailwind's responsive breakpoints
- **Theme Variation Testing**: Visual validation of dark mode and color scheme variations
- **State Testing**: Capture hover, focus, active, and disabled states

### 3. Interactive Styling Verification
Use Playwright to test dynamic styling and user interactions:
- **Hover Effects**: Test hover: utilities and transition animations
- **Focus States**: Validate focus: classes and accessibility indicators
- **Active States**: Test active: utilities and pressed states
- **Animation Testing**: Verify transition and animation utilities work correctly

### 4. Cross-Browser Compatibility
Ensure consistent Tailwind rendering across browser engines:

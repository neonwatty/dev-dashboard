# Dev Dashboard Improvements

This directory contains detailed improvement tasks based on comprehensive testing of the Dev Dashboard application. Each file represents a category of improvements with independent, assignable tasks.

## Overview

After thorough testing of both desktop and mobile views, we've identified opportunities for enhancement across six key areas. The tasks are designed to be:

- **Independent**: Each task can be completed without dependencies on others
- **Assignable**: Clear scope and requirements for delegation to agents or developers
- **Measurable**: Specific acceptance criteria for each task
- **Prioritized**: Marked as High, Medium, or Low priority

## Improvement Categories

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start with High Priority Tasks**: Focus on tasks marked as "High" priority first
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Each task includes specific acceptance criteria
3. **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Consider Performance**: Monitor impact on Core Web Vitals
5. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation as you implement

## Task Assignment

When assigning tasks to agents:

1. Provide the specific task ID (e.g., TASK-AUTH-001)
2. Reference the full task description from the relevant file
3. Ensure the agent has access to the codebase
4. Set up proper testing environment
5. Review against acceptance criteria

## Testing Requirements

Each category includes specific testing requirements. Generally:

- Test on real devices when possible
- Verify both light and dark modes
- Check mobile and desktop views
- Validate accessibility with screen readers
- Measure performance impact

## Current Status

All tasks are currently in "TODO" status. Update this README as tasks are completed.

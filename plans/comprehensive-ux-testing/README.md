  - Mobile device simulation testing (iPhone SE, iPhone 12, Pixel 5, iPad)
  - Performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals
  - Accessibility automation with aXe integration
  - Integration with existing Rails test suite

### Phase 5: Integration and Pipeline Setup
**Agent**: ruby-rails-expert + test-runner-fixer
**Tasks**: 
- Integration with existing Rails test suite
- Test execution pipeline creation
- CI/CD integration
**Quality Gates**: 
- Tests integrated with Rails suite
- Pipeline executing correctly

### Phase 6: Code Quality and Documentation
**Agent**: javascript-package-expert + test-runner-fixer
**Tasks**: 
- ESLint linting on test files
- Generate comprehensive findings report
- Document test procedures
**Quality Gates**: 
- Zero linting errors
- Documentation complete

### Phase 7: Finalization
**Agent**: git-auto-commit
**Tasks**: 
- Commit completed UX testing infrastructure
**Quality Gates**: 
- All changes committed properly

## Test-Driven Development Strategy
- **TDD Cycle**: Infrastructure Setup → Test Creation → Validation → Performance → Integration
- **Coverage Target**: 90% UX coverage across desktop and mobile scenarios
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - Cross-browser compatibility
  - Multi-resolution responsive behavior
  - Touch interaction fidelity
  - Performance regression detection
  - Accessibility compliance

## Technical Architecture

### Playwright Configuration
```javascript
// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  testDir: './spec/system/playwright',
  use: {
    headless: true,
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure'
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
    { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
    { name: 'mobile-chrome', use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] } },
    { name: 'mobile-safari', use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] } },
    { name: 'tablet', use: { ...devices['iPad Pro'] } }
  ]
};
```

### Integration Points
- **Existing Mobile Infrastructure**: Leverage touch gesture controllers
- **Rails Test Suite**: Integrate with existing system tests
- **Performance Monitoring**: Build on existing optimization features
- **Accessibility**: Extend current WCAG AA compliance

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Playwright MCP integration complexity
- **Medium Risk**: Performance test reliability across environments
- **Low Risk**: Integration with existing test suite

## Success Metrics

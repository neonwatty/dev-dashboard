- Basic responsive layout system

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Mobile component optimization (Phase 2)
- Keyboard navigation enhancements
- Progressive image loading
- Test coverage improvements

### ðŸ“‹ Todo (High Priority)
1. **Production Blockers** (See [production tasks](./04-production-readiness-tasks.md))
   - API credentials configuration
   - Database migration from SQLite
   - Security headers and CORS
   - Email configuration

2. **Mobile Features** (See [mobile tasks](./01-mobile-optimization-tasks.md))
   - Bottom navigation bar
   - Touch gestures (swipe, pull-to-refresh)
   - Component mobile optimization
   - Form mobile improvements

3. **Critical Testing** (See [testing tasks](./05-testing-tasks.md))
   - JavaScript interaction tests
   - Security test suite
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Edge case coverage

## Recommended Execution Order

### Phase 1: Production Blockers (1-2 days)
1. Configure all API credentials
2. Migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL
3. Set up background job processing
4. Configure email delivery

### Phase 2: Complete Mobile Optimization (3-4 days)
1. Finish component mobile redesign
2. Implement touch interactions
3. Add bottom navigation
4. Polish mobile UI

### Phase 3: Testing & Security (2-3 days)
1. Add JavaScript test coverage
2. Implement security tests
3. Perform load testing
4. Fix any discovered issues

### Phase 4: Performance & Polish (2-3 days)
1. Complete image optimization
2. Implement remaining caching
3. Add monitoring and alerts
4. Final accessibility audit

### Phase 5: Deployment (1-2 days)
1. Configure production environment
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Deploy to staging
4. Production deployment

## Total Estimated Timeline

- **Critical Path**: 9-14 days
- **Including all optimizations**: 3-4 weeks

## Quick Commands

### Check specific task list:
```bash
cat plans/tasks/01-mobile-optimization-tasks.md
cat plans/tasks/02-accessibility-tasks.md
cat plans/tasks/03-performance-tasks.md
cat plans/tasks/04-production-readiness-tasks.md
cat plans/tasks/05-testing-tasks.md
```

### Search for specific tasks:
```bash
grep -n "TODO" plans/tasks/*.md
grep -n "IN PROGRESS" plans/tasks/*.md
grep -n "COMPLETED" plans/tasks/*.md
```

## Key Metrics to Track

### Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Lighthouse Mobile Score > 90
- [ ] All touch targets â‰¥ 44px
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 3s

### Accessibility
- [ ] WCAG AA compliance
- [ ] Screen reader tested
- [ ] Keyboard navigable

### Performance
- [ ] Initial bundle < 100KB
- [ ] API responses < 200ms
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80%

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Zero critical security issues
- [ ] All credentials configured
- [ ] Error tracking active

### Testing
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] All edge cases covered
- [ ] Security tests passing

## Notes

- Tasks marked with ðŸš¨ in production readiness MUST be completed before deployment
- Mobile optimization can be deployed incrementally
- Performance optimizations can be ongoing
- Security must be addressed before public launch

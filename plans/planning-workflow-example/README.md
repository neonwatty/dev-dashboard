# Planning Workflow Example Plan

## Overview
This is a test plan to demonstrate the new planning workflow system. It shows how the planning-agent creates structured plans that are stored in the @plans/ directory and executed by the project-orchestrator.

## Goals
- **Primary**: Validate the planning workflow works end-to-end
- **Secondary**: Create a reference example for future planning
- **Success Criteria**: Plan is created, stored, and can be executed

## Requirements
- **Functional**: Test all aspects of the planning system
- **Non-functional**: Workflow should be smooth and intuitive
- **Constraints**: Use only existing agent infrastructure

## Todo List
- [ ] Task 1: Verify planning-agent can create plans (Agent: planning-agent, Priority: High)
- [ ] Task 2: Confirm plans are saved to correct directory (Agent: planning-agent, Priority: High)
- [ ] Task 3: Test project-orchestrator can read and execute plans (Agent: project-orchestrator, Priority: High)
- [ ] Task 4: Validate automatic handoffs work correctly (Agent: project-orchestrator, Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Task 5: Document workflow in action (Agent: planning-agent, Priority: Low)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Planning System Test (Duration: 30 minutes)
**Agent**: planning-agent
**Tasks**:
1. Create this example plan
2. Save to @plans/planning-workflow-example/
**Dependencies**: Planning infrastructure must be in place
**Deliverables**: This plan document

### Phase 2: Execution Test (Duration: 30 minutes)
**Agent**: project-orchestrator
**Tasks**:
1. Read this plan from disk
2. Parse delegation instructions
3. Execute a simple task sequence
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion
**Deliverables**: Successful execution log

## Agent Delegation Plan
```
DELEGATION SEQUENCE:
1. planning-agent: Create and save this plan
   - Success criteria: Plan exists at correct location
   - Handoff trigger: File saved successfully

2. project-orchestrator: Execute the plan
   - Dependencies: Plan file must exist
   - Completion signal: All phases executed
```

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk 1**: File paths might be incorrect → Mitigation: Use absolute paths
- **Risk 2**: Handoff might fail → Mitigation: Clear completion signals

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each agent works independently
- **Integration Tests**: Handoffs between agents work
- **User Acceptance**: Workflow feels natural

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Plan created successfully
- [ ] Plan saved to correct location
- [ ] Plan can be executed by orchestrator

## Automatic Execution Command
```bash
Task(description="Execute planning workflow test",
     subagent_type="project-orchestrator",
     prompt="Execute the plan at plans/planning-workflow-example/README.md to validate the planning system works")
```
